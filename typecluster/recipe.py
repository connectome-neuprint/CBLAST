        est_neuron_per_cluster (int): estimated number of neurons per cluster (set high?)

    Note:
        Evaluating results could be done by looking at the worst distance for different levels of clustering.
        In addition, features computed with different recipes can be compared using 'report_diffs'.
        It probably make sense to produce final cluster results at different levels (conservative,
        mediumn, aggressive, etc).
